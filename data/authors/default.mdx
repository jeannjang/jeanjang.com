Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Hoon, and I'm all about embracing personal growth and diving into new experiences.

During my time as an office manager, I ventured into web programming to boost work efficiency. What started as a small step turned into a journey of creating prototypes, securing project approvals, and eventually shaping it into a vital solution for the company. Fast forward, and now I proudly wear the hat of a software engineer.

But hey, the learning vibe doesn't take a backseat! ðŸš€ This blog is my little corner to spill the beans on all the burning questions I've got about software engineering and share the cool answers I stumble upon. Ready to ride this continuous learning wave with me? ðŸŒŸ
