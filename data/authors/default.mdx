Hello, I’m Jean.  
I’m a software engineer who enjoys turning real-world problems into practical solutions, and I believe that steady personal growth and self-learning are my biggest strengths.

While working in a manual task-heavy job, I experienced firsthand the inefficiencies in real workplace systems. That led me to start learning software development.
I don’t just want to learn theory—I focus on building practical, usable projects. One example is a Chrome extension I created using real Netflix subtitle data, designed to help with language learning.

This blog is where I document my journey of growth. It’s more than just a collection of technical notes—it’s about using technology to solve real-life problems that matter.
I will keep learning, building, and growing.
And if something I create through my self-learning journey can help someone, even in a small way, that’s meaningful enough for me.
