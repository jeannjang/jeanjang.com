# hoonjung.me

Welcome to my personal blog, crafted using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), and [Contentlayer](https://contentlayer.dev/).

I've implemented several custom features on top of the [tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog), including:
- [x] A dynamic [Table of contents](https://github.com/go-hoon/hoonjung.me/commit/4ec6700b22da2b7b56dd68937724ad5a7858eac9), improving navigation and readability.
- [x] Integrated CI/CD workflows, streamlining deployment and updates.
